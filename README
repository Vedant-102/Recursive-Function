In C programming, a recursive function is a function that calls itself, either directly or indirectly, to solve a problem. This technique is often used to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable subproblems that are identical in nature to the original problem.
	
Key Components of a Recursive Function:
Base Case: This is a condition that defines when the recursion should stop. Without a base case, a recursive function would call itself indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow error. The base case provides a direct solution for the simplest instance of the problem.
Recursive Case: This is the part of the function where it calls itself with a modified or smaller version of the input, moving closer to the base case.

How Recursion Works:
When a recursive function is called, an activation record (also known as a stack frame) is created on the call stack. This record stores local variables, parameters, and the return address for that particular function call. When the function calls itself, a new activation record is pushed onto the stack. This process continues until the base case is reached. Once the base case returns a value, the activation records are popped from the stack in reverse order, and the returned values are used to compute the final result.
	
	Advantages of Recursion:
Provides elegant and concise solutions for problems that can be naturally defined in terms of smaller, similar subproblems (e.g., tree traversals, quicksort).
Can make code more readable and easier to understand for certain types of problems.


	Disadvantages of Recursion:
Can be less efficient than iterative solutions due to the overhead of function calls and stack management.
Can lead to stack overflow errors if the recursion depth is too large and exceeds the available stack space.
Debugging recursive functions can sometimes be more challenging.

In this program, we print a numeric pattern & the number of rows will be taken as the user input. We will use 2 recursive functions, printRow() & printPattern().
printRow(): It prints numbers starting from 1 upto the current row number. It calls itself, increasing the number until it reaches the limit
printPattern(): It calls printRow() to print the current line, prints a newline character & then recursively calls itself for the next row until it reaches the user’s desired number of rows.
